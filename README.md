# EnjoysthingsArchiver

EnjoysthingsArchiver is a python script that allows you to download all the items in your http://enjoysthin.gs/ account. They are saved as a single JSON data file. This file contains links to the images you've enjoyed on the original sites, no actual images are downloaded. Enjoyed items of type image, page, video and selected text are stored.

## Requirements

You need to have python installed on your machine.

## Using it

Open up a terminal and run
    python archive.py <username> <userid>

where <username> is replaced with your username from enjoysthings. For example:
    python archive.py vasil9v

The archive will be saved in a file in the same folder named "all.items.json".

We will miss you enjoysthin.gs!
